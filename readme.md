Each `.jsonl` file contains a list of prompt-response pairs, one per line.

## ðŸ§  ChatGPT/Copilot Collaboration

This dataset is being developed in collaboration with AI, using the following structured workflow:

- Prompts and responses are generated interactively and reviewed in-session
- Changes are issued as **separate pull requests**, one per logical unit of work
- PR descriptions may include quotes or transcripts from conversations for context
- All responses are optionally validated against [MicroPython Documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/)

## ðŸ§ª Token Context Management

In conversations with an agent:
- Typing `##DISCARD FROM HERE##` indicates that all prior conversation context can be deprioritized or purged from memory
- This helps manage long sessions within token limits (128k context)

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repo

If you're using this as a base for your own fine-tuning:

1. Clone the repo
2. Select or customize subcategories
3. Feed `.jsonl` files into your LoRA training pipeline (e.g., `peft`, `Axolotl`, `QLoRA`)
4. Validate results with your model using structured tests or interactive review

## ðŸ“Œ Future Goals

- Include test coverage datasets (e.g., expected model completions)
- Add platform-specific code distinctions (e.g., ESP32 vs. Raspberry Pi Pico)
- Link to model outputs and benchmarks for comparison

ðŸ™Œ Contributions
This is starting as a personal project, but it would be cool if this became a public endeavor.
I'd love for the effort to help more than just myself.

I welcome pull requests to improve this repo. I only ask for your patience as I'm still learning â€”
at this time, ChatGPT gets a lot of credit as the brains behind this operation!
